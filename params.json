{"name":"Neo.github.io","tagline":"Number Extraction in the Open Domain","body":"The goal of this project is to create knowledge bases with numerical attributes of entities by automatically extracting such data from unstructured web documents. The extractors will be bootstrapped from existing structured repositories of numerical data such as Wikipedia infoboxes, DBPedia or Freebase.  Extractors could either be specialized for a known attribute of an entity type “e.g. Population of a city” or discover new attributes “e.g. number of annual migrants to a city”.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
